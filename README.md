Traffic Sign Classification

The purpose of this project was to train self-driving cars to detect traffic lights and signs in real time in order to attain level 5 autonomous driving. Traffic sign detection and classification is of paramount importance for the future of autonomous vehicle technology. In order to achieve accuracy with this technology, the vehicles must be able to comprehend traffic signs and make appropriate decisions.
 In this Python project, we'll create a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signals in an image into many categories. We can read and understand traffic signs using our model, which is a fundamental requirement for all autonomous vehicles.

For this project, we are using the public Kaggle dataset available at : https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign

The dataset contains more than 50,000 images of different traffic signs. It is further classified into 43 different classes. The dataset is quite varying, some of the classes have many images while some classes have few images. The dataset has a train folder which contains images inside each class and a test folder which we will use for testing our model.
